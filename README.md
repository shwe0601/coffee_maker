##Description
About A Coffee Machine Simulator What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. 
You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.
